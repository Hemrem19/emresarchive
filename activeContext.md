# Active Context: Emre's Archive

This document tracks the current work focus, recent decisions, and next steps.

## Recent Changes & Decisions

- **Project Renamed:** The project has been renamed from "Research Hub" to "Emre's Archive".
- **Feature Complete:** All major features, including data import/export and advanced paper linking, are implemented.
- **Bug Fixes:** Several bugs related to event listener duplication and routing have been resolved, making the application more stable.
- **UI Enhancements:** The application is now fully responsive with a mobile sidebar that is scrollable and always accessible. Search, sorting, and filtering capabilities have been significantly improved. A dark mode, statistics, and an improved "Add Paper" form have also been added. A critical bug preventing pages from loading due to DOM rendering race conditions has been resolved, significantly improving application stability and reliability.
- **Code Quality:** The codebase has been significantly improved by refactoring the monolithic `app.js` into smaller, single-responsibility modules (`ui.js`, `views.js`, `api.js`). This improves maintainability and separation of concerns.

## Current State

The project is in a stable, feature-complete state. All core requirements from the project brief and subsequent enhancement requests have been fulfilled. The codebase is clean and follows the established local-first architectural patterns.

## Next Steps

The project is ready for new feature enhancements or further UI refinements based on user feedback.
