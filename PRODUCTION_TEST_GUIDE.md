## üîç How to Test

### 1. Open Frontend
```
URL: https://citaversa.com
```

### 2. Open Browser DevTools
- Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows) / `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
- Go to **Console** tab for logs
- Go to **Network** tab for API requests

### 3. Monitor API Calls
In Network tab:
- Filter by "Fetch/XHR"
- Look for requests to `emresarchive-production.up.railway.app`
- Check status codes (200 = success, 401 = auth error, 500 = server error)

### 4. Check Console Logs
Look for:
- ‚úÖ `CORS: Allowed origin: https://citaversa.com` (CORS working)
- ‚úÖ `Cloud sync enabled` (when enabled)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `Cloud sync failed, falling back to local` (fallback working)
- ‚ùå `Error:` (any errors)

## üìä Expected API Endpoints

You should see calls to:
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout
- `GET /api/papers` - Get all papers
- `POST /api/papers` - Create paper
- `PUT /api/papers/:id` - Update paper
- `DELETE /api/papers/:id` - Delete paper
- `POST /api/papers/upload-url` - Get S3 upload URL
- `GET /api/papers/:id/pdf-url` - Get S3 download URL

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "CORS Missing Allow Origin"
- **Check:** Railway `FRONTEND_URL` variable set correctly
- **Check:** URL matches exactly (including https://)
- **Fix:** Update Railway environment variable

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized"
- **Check:** User is logged in (check auth state)
- **Check:** Token not expired
- **Fix:** Logout and login again

### Issue: "500 Internal Server Error"
- **Check:** Railway logs for error details
- **Check:** DATABASE_URL is correct format
- **Check:** All environment variables set

### Issue: "NetworkError"
- **Check:** Backend is running (check Railway dashboard)
- **Check:** API URL in `config.js` is correct
- **Check:** Network connectivity
