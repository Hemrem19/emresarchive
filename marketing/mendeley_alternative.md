## 2. "Why Switch?" Section

You need a tool that works for you, not for a large publisher. We built citavErs for researchers who value privacy, data ownership, and a beautiful, stable workflow.

<div class="grid">

**Pain Point 1: Data Lock-in & Privacy Concerns**
> **Mendeley:** Your data is stored on Elsevier's servers, tying you to their ecosystem. Many researchers are uncomfortable trusting a major publisher with their entire research library.
> **citavErs Solution:** A **local-first architecture**. Your data lives on your computer by default. Cloud sync is optional, secure, and respects your privacy. You own your data, always.

**Pain Point 2: Discontinued Features & Instability**
> **Mendeley:** Users were frustrated by the discontinuation of the beloved native desktop client, forcing them into a less powerful web-based workflow.
> **citavErs Solution:** A stable, reliable platform built for the long term. Our app works perfectly offline, giving you the power of a desktop app with the convenience of a modern web interface.

**Pain Point 3: A Stagnant Experience**
> **Mendeley:** The core experience has seen little innovation, lacking modern productivity and discovery tools.
> **citavErs Solution:** Discover new insights with the **Paper Network Graph**, fly through your work with the **Command Palette (`Ctrl+K`)**, and enjoy a fluid, fast, and beautiful interface designed for today's researchers.
