## 2. "Why Switch?" Section

You love Zotero's open-source, local-first approach. So do we. That's why we built citavErs on the same principles, but with the modern interface and "wow" features you've been missing.

<div class="grid">

**Pain Point 1: Dated & Slow Interface**
> **Zotero:** Feels like desktop software from a decade ago. It's powerful, but clunky and slow to navigate.
> **citavErs Solution:** A fluid, beautiful, and fast web-native UI. With a **Command Palette (`Ctrl+K`)**, keyboard shortcuts, and a clean design, your workflow will be faster than ever.

**Pain Point 2: No Visual Discovery**
> **Zotero:** Your library is a list of text. Seeing the connections between papers requires complex plugins.
> **citavErs Solution:** The built-in **Paper Network Graph** lets you visually explore the relationships in your research. Discover new connections and see your knowledge in a whole new way.

**Pain Point 3: Productivity Friction**
> **Zotero:** Relies heavily on pointing and clicking through menus.
> **citavErs Solution:** Designed for power users. Add papers by DOI in seconds, use batch actions to manage your library, and fly through the app with our Command Palette.
