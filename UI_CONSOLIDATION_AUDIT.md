# UI Consolidation Audit Report

**Date:** Current Session  
**Version:** 1.8 (Database v5)  
**Task:** B1 - Consolidate Draft UI Layouts  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive review, **all draft files are outdated and should be deleted**. The current live application (`views.js` + view modules) contains a significantly more advanced, feature-rich, and consistent UI compared to the initial draft files.

**Recommendation:** Delete all draft files and maintain only the live codebase.
