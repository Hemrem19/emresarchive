### 2. Add/Edit Paper Form
- A form for manual entry of paper details:
  - Title
  - Authors (comma-separated)
  - Journal / Conference
  - Publication Year
  - URL or DOI
  - Tags (comma-separated)
- Optional PDF file upload.

### 3. Paper Detail & Notes View

- A "Download PDF" button and an embedded PDF previewer if a file is attached.
- A rich text editor for taking notes, supporting:

### 4. Data Management
